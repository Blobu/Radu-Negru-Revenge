# Radu Negru Revenge

A private, friend-only tower-defense game inspired by **Plants vs Zombies**, built in **Unreal Engine 5.6**.

## What this project is

`Radu Negru Revenge` is a school-themed strategy game where:
- "Plants" are members of our friend group.
- "Zombies" are also people from our group plus some teachers.
- Maps, UI, powers, and progression are full of high-school references and inside jokes.

This project is intentionally private and will not be published outside the group.

## Why this project exists

This game is a personal learning project to become a better game developer.
It ensures a small but trusted comunity that will give honest feedback.

## Core gameplay pillars

Compared to classic Plants vs Zombies-style gameplay, this project adds extra progression depth:

1. **Rarity system** for units (common, rare, epic, legendary).
2. **Upgradeable stats** for each unit.
3. **Pack opening system** to unlock units.
4. **Reference-heavy content** tied to our school and friend group lore.
5. **Leaderboard** to be more competitive 

## Tech snapshot

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.6.
- **Target platform:** Windows & Android.
- **Plugins used:** `HttpBlueprint`, `VaRest`.

## Privacy and content policy

This repository contains personal content (faces, names, and school-specific references). Because of that:

- Do not redistribute builds publicly.
- Do not share media assets outside the friend group.

## Current state

The project is almost complete gameplay-wise, it needs to be tested and user experience improvements.
