# Radu Negru Revenge

A private, friend-only tower-defense game inspired by **Plants vs Zombies**, built in **Unreal Engine 5.6**.

## What this project is

`Radu Negru Revenge` is a school-themed strategy game where:
- "Plants" are members of our friend group.
- "Zombies" are also people from our group, plus some notoriously difficult teachers.
- Maps, UI, powers, and overall progression are packed with high-school references and inside jokes.

This project is intentionally private and will not be published outside the group.

## Why this project exists

This game is a personal learning project designed to help me become a better game developer. It serves as a playground for implementing complex game mechanics, AI balancing, and database management, while ensuring a small but trusted community that will provide honest feedback.

## Core Gameplay Pillars

Compared to classic tower-defense games, this project adds significant progression depth, diverse mechanics, and a competitive edge:

### 🌻 The Roster & Abilities
- **Massive Character Pool:** Over **70** unique playable characters and various distinct enemy types.
- **Dynamic Plant Abilities:** Build your deck using characters with specialized roles: *Long-range attacks, Close-range attacks, Tanks, Healers, Fire damage, Stun, Tick damage, Lane changing, Shield providers, Damage boosters, Critical hits, and Explosive Bombs.*
- **Advanced Zombie AI:** Enemies are not just mindless walkers. You will face zombies that can *change lanes*, *stun your plants*, act as colossal *meatshields*, sprint at high speeds, or even *spawn child-zombies* when taking damage.

### 📈 Progression System
- **Rarity System:** Units are divided into Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary tiers.
- **Pack Opening:** Unlock new characters by purchasing and opening gacha-style packs using in-game currency (Money & Beer).
- **Upgrades:** Spend resources to permanently upgrade your characters' stats to face tougher waves.

### 🗺️ Game Modes
- **The Campaign (9 Levels + Boss):** A carefully handcrafted story mode featuring 9 levels with escalating difficulty, complex zombie swarms, and a highly tactical final Boss Fight in Level 10.
- **Infinite Mode** An endless, wave-based survival mode where zombies scale infinitely in Health and Damage. Players must constantly adapt their economy and board layout to survive as long as possible.

## 🌐 Online Mode & Cloud Integration

The game features a fully integrated backend system:
- **Cloud Database:** Player profiles are stored in the cloud.
- **Cross-Device Play:** Log into your account from any supported device and pick up exactly where you left off.
- **Global Leaderboard:** A competitive in-game menu ranks all players in the database based on the highest number of waves survived in Infinite Mode.

## Tech Snapshot

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.6
- **Target Platform:** Windows & Android
- **Plugins Used:** `HttpBlueprint` (for API calls), `VaRest` (for JSON/REST backend communication)
- **Backend:** Cloud Database integration for real-time saving and leaderboard fetching.

## Privacy and Content Policy

This repository contains personal content (faces, names, and school-specific references). Because of that:

- Do not redistribute builds publicly.
- Do not share media assets outside the friend group.

## Current State

The project is almost complete gameplay-wise. Currently focusing on playtesting, balancing the late-game economy/waves, and overall user experience (UX) improvements.
